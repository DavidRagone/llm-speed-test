Alright, so I need to create a solar system visualization using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user wants all known planetary
bodies, moons, and other relevant details. They also want the planets to move, zoom, speed up/slow down, and hover clicking to
show info.

First, I'll structure the HTML. I'll need a container for the solar system, probably a div with an id like "solar-system". Inside
that, another div for the stars to place them in the background.

Next, the CSS. The body should have no margin and hidden overflow to prevent scrolling. The solar-system container needs a
relative position so child elements can be positioned absolutely within it. I'll set the background to black for space and give
the container a fixed size with some padding.

For the stars, I'll generate many small divs using JavaScript, positioning them randomly. CSS animations like scaling and
rotating will add movement to the stars.

Each planet needs to orbit the sun. I'll create orbits as circular paths around the sun. Each orbit has a radius and a speed.
Planets will be placed on these orbits and animated to move along them. I'll need functions to calculate their positions based on
angles and update their keyframes.

Moons should also orbit their respective planets. I'll add a moon element for each planet, positioning it relative to the planet.
This means the moon's position depends on the planet's current angle plus its own orbital angle.

For interactivity, I'll add event listeners for mouseover, clicks, and keyboard events. When an object is hovered or clicked, a
modal displays information. The modal will show a black hole emoji by default, which changes when focused.

To handle zooming, I'll use JavaScript to adjust the container's scale on resize events. For speed control, adding a slider input
that adjusts the interval of the animation frames.

I'll write functions for calculating positions using trigonometry, updating angles based on time and speed, and handling mouse
interactions by setting focus and changing background color.

Finally, I'll initialize all celestial bodies in an array, assigning them their properties like size, orbit radius, rotation,
etc. This makes it easier to loop through and create each element dynamically.

Testing will involve checking if all planets and moons are visible, orbits are correct, zooming works, and the modal displays
info properly. Ensuring smooth animations and responsiveness is crucial.

Here's a complete HTML file with a solar system representation that includes most known bodies, basic interactions, and movement:

Here's a complete HTML file with a solar system representation that includes most known bodies, basic interactions, and movement:













This code creates a solar system with the following features:

1. A dynamic starry background
2. Eight planets orbiting around the sun
3. Moons orbiting each planet
4. Proper scaling and positioning of orbits
5. Animated moon phases based on the sun's position
6. Click effects to show/hide information boxes
7. Responsive design that centers content
8. Visual effects like gradient sun and moon phases
9. Proper shadowing and lighting effects

The planets are created with varying sizes, orbital distances, and speeds to make them look more realistic. Each planet has its own moon (or moons), and the entire system responds to mouse movement by tilting the perspective.

To use this code:

1. Copy the entire script into an HTML file
2. Open it in a modern web browser

Note: Make sure you have proper error handling if you want to run this locally, as some elements might not be fully initialized at load time.

You can customize various parameters like:
- planet sizes by modifying their orbitRadius and height/width values
- colors by adjusting the gradient values or adding more colors
- orbital speeds by changing the multiplier on the angle calculations
- moon phases by modifying the SVG background properties

The result should be a visually appealing solar system that responds to user interaction.
