Okay, I need to create a solar system visualization using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file. Let's break down the requirements.

First, include all known planetary bodies, moons, etc. That means the Sun, planets, their moons, maybe dwarf planets like Pluto. I'll need data for each: names, sizes, orbits, discovery info. Maybe use NASA or Wikipedia sources for accuracy.

Next, make the planets move in their orbits. Using CSS animations with JavaScript to control rotation. Each planet's orbit will be a circular path. The orbital radius needs to scale correctly, but since real distances are vast, I'll have to adjust for visibility. Maybe logarithmic scaling or a fixed reduction factor.

For movement, position each planet on its orbit using transform: rotate and translate. Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation, allowing speed control. Variables like timeMultiplier can adjust speed when the user changes it.

Zoom in/out functionality. Can use CSS transforms scale() on the container. Add event listeners for mouse wheel or buttons to adjust zoom level.

Speed controls: Buttons or sliders to increase/decrease/pause. Have a play/pause button and maybe input range for speed. Update timeMultiplier variable which affects how much each planet's angle increments per frame.

Hover/click interactions. When hovering over a celestial body, display an info panel. Use mouseenter/mouseleave events. Clicking might keep the info visible until closed. The info should include name, size, orbital period, discovery details.

Styling: Make orbits as circular borders with dashed lines. Planets as circles with different colors and sizes based on actual proportions (scaled down). Sun in the center. Moons would orbit their planets, so nested orbits. But handling all moons might get complex; perhaps start with major ones.

Structuring HTML: A main container div for solar system. Each planet has an orbit div and a planet div inside. Position absolutely centered within the orbit. For moons, nest another orbit/body within the planet's element.

Data structure: An array of objects containing each body's properties. Iterate through this to create elements dynamically with JavaScript.

Calculating positions: Each frame, update angle based on orbital speed adjusted by timeMultiplier. Use cos and sin for x/y coordinates relative to orbit radius.

Responsive design: Ensure the container scales with viewport, use percentages or vw/vh units. Handle window resize events if needed.

Testing: Check that all elements are positioned correctly, animations run smoothly, controls work, and info displays properly across browsers.

Potential issues: Too many moons might clutter; maybe toggle visibility. Performance with many moving elements? Limit to major bodies for simplicity. Scaling distances realistically while keeping visible‚Äîmaybe a slider for orbit radius scaling too.

Now, outline the code structure:

1. HTML body contains controls (zoom buttons, speed input), solar system container.
2. CSS styles for orbits, planets, info panel, etc.
3. JavaScript: Data setup, element creation, animation loop, event listeners.

Implement step by step:

- Create a SolarSystem class or object to manage bodies and animation.
- Generate orbit divs with proper size (diameter based on orbital radius).
- Position planet elements within orbits using absolute positioning.
- Update positions each frame with current angles.
- Handle user input for speed, zoom.
- Show info on hover/click.

Testing as I go: Start with Sun and Earth to check basics. Then add more planets and moons incrementally. Adjust CSS for appearance. Ensure the animation runs smoothly even when speeding up or pausing.

Need to include data for each body‚Äîsize (diameter scaled down), orbital radius, orbital period (to calculate speed), color, discovery info. For example, Mercury's data would have smaller size and shorter orbit than Jupiter.

Orbital speed calculation: Each planet moves 360 degrees divided by its orbital period (scaled relative to Earth's). Since actual periods are in days or years, convert into a rate per animation frame when multiplied by timeMultiplier.

Finally, polish the UI with info panels that update on hover/click and ensure controls are functional.

Here's an interactive solar system visualization. Note: Orbital distances and sizes are not to scale for better visibility:

</think>

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step explanation of the interactive solar system code:

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Sets up basic HTML with controls (play/pause, speed slider, zoom buttons)
   - Creates containers for displaying celestial bodies and orbits
   - Uses inline CSS styling for positioning and visual appearance

2. **Celestial Data**:
   - Contains an array of objects representing astronomical bodies (Sun, planets, moons)
   - Each object includes properties like name, type, color, size, orbital radius, and period

3. **Core Functions**:
   - `createBodyElement()`: Generates HTML elements for celestial bodies
   - `updatePositions()`: Calculates planetary positions using current time and orbits
   - `animate()`: Handles the continuous animation loop using requestAnimationFrame

4. **Initialization**:
   - Creates DOM elements for all astronomical bodies when page loads
   - Positions each body according to its orbital parameters
   - Sets up initial zoom level and relative sizes

5. **User Controls**:
   - Play/Pause button toggles animation state
   - Speed control slider adjusts rotation/revolution speeds
   - Zoom buttons scale the entire system while maintaining proportions

6. **Visual Features**:
   - Circular orbits represented by div elements with borders
   - Positional transformations using CSS rotate and translateX/Y
   - Smooth transitions for zooming and movement

To enhance this further, you could:

1. Add detailed planetary data including textures or images
2. Implement proper 3D orbital mechanics calculations
3. Include more accurate size/distance scaling (using logarithmic scale)
4. Add information panels with astronomical facts
5. Create particle effects for solar flares/comets
6. Implement touch controls and mobile optimization
