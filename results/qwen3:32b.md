Okay, I need to create a beautiful solar system representation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file. Let me start by outlining the components I need to include.

First, the structure. I'll need a container for the canvas where the solar system will be drawn. Then, I'll need controls for zooming, speed adjustment, and pausing. Also, a way to display information when hovering or clicking on a planetary body.

For the planetary bodies, I should include the Sun, all eight planets, their moons, and maybe some dwarf planets like Pluto. Each body will have properties like position, radius, orbital radius, speed, color, and information like name, size, rotation period, etc.

The movement part requires calculating the orbits. Since it's a 2D representation, I can use circular orbits with some easing for moons. The planets should orbit the Sun, and moons orbit their respective planets.

Zooming in and out can be handled by scaling the canvas context. Speed control will adjust the animation's time factor, and pausing stops the animation loop.

Now, for the data structure. I'll create an array of objects for each celestial body. Each object will have properties like name, radius, distance from the sun, orbital speed, color, and additional info. Moons will orbit their parent planets, so their data should
reference the parent.

The canvas drawing will involve updating positions over time. For each frame, clear the canvas, redraw the Sun, then all planets and their moons in order. The position of each body is calculated using trigonometric functions based on their orbital speed and elapsed
time.

Event handlers are needed for zoom in/out buttons, speed controls, and pause/resume. For tooltips, using a div that appears on hover or click. The canvas click and mousemove events will check which body is under the cursor and display info.

CSS styling should make the interface look good, with a dark background, buttons for controls, and a responsive layout. The canvas should take up most of the screen.

Potential issues: Performance with many bodies, but since it's a simplified model, it should be okay. Also, scaling the canvas might affect the drawing, so I need to adjust the context's scale property.

Testing each part step by step. Start with the Sun and one planet, then add more. Make sure orbits are smooth. Then add moons. Then implement controls and tooltips.

Let me structure the HTML with a canvas element, control buttons, and an info div. The CSS will style the page. The JavaScript will handle the data, animation loop, and interactions.

Now, code-wise, I'll start by setting up the canvas and context. Then define the celestial bodies array. The animation loop will update the positions and redraw. The drawing function will handle the orbits, scaling, and tooltips.

For the zoom, I'll track a scale factor and adjust it with buttons. Speed is a multiplier on the orbital speed. Pausing is a boolean that stops the animation loop.

To detect clicks or hovers on bodies, I'll calculate the distance from the cursor to each body's position. If it's within the radius, show the info.

I need to make sure all data is accurate. For example, orbital periods, sizes, colors. Some moons might be too many to include, but maybe pick major ones like Earth's Moon, Jupiter's Galilean moons, etc.

Also, when the user resizes the window, the canvas should adjust, so a resize event listener to maintain aspect ratio.

Finally, testing all features: zoom, speed, pause, and info display.
