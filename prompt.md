Create a beautiful representation of the solar system using only HTML, CSS, and
Javascript. Do it in one HTML file using <script> and <style> tags. No React.
Include all known planetary bodies, moons, and anything else that we know about
the solar system.  Make the planetary bodies move in their orbits. Make it so 
that the viewer can zoom in and out, as well as speed up or slow down or pause 
the movement of the planets. Clicking on or hovering over a planetary body
should show the viewer information about that body, such as its name, size,
rotation, what it orbits and how fast its orbit is, and when it was discovered 
and by whom.
